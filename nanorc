#    homebrew-dupes: These formulae duplicate software provided by OS X, though may provide more recent or bugfix versions.
#
#    Add the dupes formulae, then install a new version of nano.
#
#    $ brew tap homebrew/dupes
#    $ brew install nano
#
#    Installing this way includes the /usr/local/share/nano folder containing the default syntax highlight files. You can now include "/usr/local/share/nano/c.nanorc" in ~/.nanorc.
#
#    Bonus: a run-once one-liner to add all languages.
#
#    $ /bin/ls /usr/local/share/nano/*.nanorc | xargs -I {} echo 'include "{}"' >> ~/.nanorc
